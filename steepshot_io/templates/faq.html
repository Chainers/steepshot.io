            <div id="panel-faq">
                Steepshot is a blockchain-powered censorship-resistant social platform that you can use to share photos
                with your family and friends. On top of that you can earn crypto rewards for everything you curate, and
                when others engage with your activity!

            <span>How does Steepshot work?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                Steepshot is the first photo-sharing Steem powered application. All rewards are generated by the Steem
                blockchain. Steem is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. Every day, a fixed reward pool is distributed among
                all users on the Steem blockchain. By upvoting content you can control how much every post should
                receive. Users on Steepshot will be rewarded with STEEM and SBD (Steem dollars) which can be exchanged
                for fiat currencies, reinvested or held on to.

                Steemit is one of the social media websites, which pays its users with the digital currency known as
                Steem for posting blogs, commenting and upvoting content.

                Adding a profile picture is not supported for now in Steepshot but you can do that on Steemit. It is a
                bit different from the other social media or blogging platforms. So it may seem hard for new Steemians.
                <p>Click your circle icon of your account on the top right corner.</p>

                The iOS app is ready and available for beta testing. It is closed, but if you want to get access, please

            <div id="panel-faq">
                Steepshot platform allows you to add more than 5 tags. The number of tags is limited to 20. We think
                that this amount is quite enough for almost any user.

            <span>Why is there a 5 minute waiting period between photos?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                This is a blockchain level restriction in Steem and is very important for Steem, which pays for the
                content. This is necessary to limit spam attacks, cheating money bots, etc. Since we use the Steem
                protocol, we also accept such rules.

        </li>
        <li name="info-getting-money">
            <span>Why am I getting less and less money on my account?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                Your amount in the tokens (STEEM, SBD) remains unchanged if you do not perform any transactions.
                However, STEEM/USD conversion rate is highly volatile, so your estimated account balance in USD may
                bounce up & down.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li name="compress-images">
            <span>Does Steepshot compress images?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                We don't accept images larger than 10MB, AND if the image is larger than 1MB we automatically compress
                it to be less than 1MB. Any image of size less than 1MB will be stored as is without any modifications.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li name="info-get-more-upvotes">
            <span>How to get more upvotes?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                <p>First of all you need to understand, that a great amount of upvotes would not help you to earn a lot
                    of money. It’s because SP influences author payouts, not upvotes count.</p>
                <p>It is better to focus on high-quality content. Try to improve constantly and you will be rewarded
                    sooner or later.</p>
                <p>Another important thing is to use correct tags. Avoid using the most popular ones
                    (steemit, steem, etc), it only will make your post disappear very fast.</p>
                <p>And don’t forget about the best time to make a post. Steepshot is being used by a great amount of
                    people from all over the world, it means that they have different time zones. Try to check what
                    time is the most profitable for you.</p>

        <li name="info-power-like">
            <span>What is the Power of Like?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                Each time you press the heart button, you spend a part of your voting power. It is constantly rebelling
                (recharging). The value of each of your likes depends on the Power of Like and your amount of Steem Power combined.
                Do not regret giving your Like Power to someone, but think who is more worthy of it!

        <li name="info-copyright-terms">
            <span>What are the copyright terms of Steepshot?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                <p>Steepshot is built on top of Steem blockchain and is using IPFS network for decentralized images
                    storage. When you create a post in Steepshot the unique IPFS hash of your picture is stored in
                    Steem blockchain together with account @username, creation date and other user info.</p>
                <p>This information is publicly available, so you can technically prove to anyone that you are the
                    person who stored this image at this specific timestamp. Copyright is a legal term, so if someone
                    succeeds in connecting the technical proof with the legal world, creating a precedent, Steepshot
                    becomes a platform where authors are granted exclusive rights for their pictures' use and
                    distribution.</p>

        <li name="steepshot-affect-on-steemit">
            <span>Do my actions on Steepshot affect my bandwidth usage on Steemit?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                The bandwidth transactions of your account are on the Steem blockchain. The Steepshot app generates
                upvote transaction in Steem each time you upvote a post or engage in some way.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li name="info-account-value">
            <span>Why does my account value fluctuate so much?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                The value or your account is based on the current value of Steem, Steem Power, and Steem Dollars.
                These fluctuate all the time with market trends, so your account value fluctuates the same way and
                shows you the value in real-time.
            </div>
        </li>
        <li name="info-steep-power-low">
            <span>I'm not able to post, comment, upvote, follow, ..., because my bandwidth (Steem Power) is too low?</span>
            <div id="panel-faq">
                In Steem your bandwidth reflects how many transactions your account is able to generate successfully
                in a fixed period of time. In order to solve this issue you can do two things: increase your bandwidth
                by powering up liquid STEEM or just wait some time for the system to let you create transaction further.
